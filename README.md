# Machine-Learning-1

Applying machine learning to malware analysis.

Build a binary classifier that can predict if a function has been compiled with optimization HIGH or LOW.

Build a multiclass classifier that can predict the compiler used to compile a specific function.

The dataset contains 30000 functions compiled with 3 different compilers: gcc, icc , clang. The optimizations distribution is not balanced.
